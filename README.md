# Top50-ASEAN-Charts-August-2022
In this repository I explore the insights contained in the top 50 song data on the ASEAN charts in August 2022. I took the data from https://kworb.net/charts/ for the song chart sequence and https://tunebat.com/ for the popularity data of each song. An analysis of each song was also carried out using the spotify API to get the audio features of the song; such as acousticness, danceability, song duration (in ms), energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, modes, speechiness, tempo and valence of the song.
